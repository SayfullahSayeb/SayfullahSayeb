Even if you’re using AI to assist, it’s helpful to manually go through and modify the code so you understand the logic, structure, and the role of each piece.\nImproves Problem-Solving Skills: Manually coding helps you develop your problem-solving abilities. You’ll encounter bugs, edge cases, and challenges that AI can’t always solve perfectly, and figuring those out on your own is a valuable skill.\nBoosts Debugging Skills: By writing your own code, you’ll become more adept at debugging and identifying problems. AI-generated code might have errors or inefficiencies that you’ll need to spot and fix.\nCustomization: AI might give you a working solution, but if you want to customize your project, add specific functionality, or tweak things to meet particular requirements, understanding how to code manually allows you to make those adjustments.\nBetter Career Prospects: Even if AI is a helpful tool, employers typically value candidates who have a strong foundational understanding of coding. In tech, you’ll often have to work on projects that require custom solutions or understanding complex business logic that AI alone can’t handle.\nHow to Balance AI and Manual Coding in Your Learning: You can use AI as a tool to enhance your learning while still focusing on mastering the fundamentals. Here’s how you can strike a balance:\nUse AI as a Pair Programming Tool:\nThink of AI as a coding assistant rather than a complete replacement. You can use it to help write sections of code or generate boilerplate, but make sure you’re still actively reviewing, modifying, and understanding the code. Example: If you’re working on a project, you can ask AI for help with syntax, generating functions, or solving specific problems, but don’t just copy-paste the code. Try to understand why it works and how it fits into your project. Work on Small, Incremental Projects:\nTry building simple projects (like a to-do list app or a personal portfolio) on your own, using AI as a resource only when you get stuck. This will give you hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As you work through projects, you’ll begin to see patterns and best practices, which AI can’t always teach you directly. Learn by Building \u0026 Customizing:\nAI-Generated Code: If AI generates code for a project, try to modify and extend it. For example, if AI generates a basic form, try adding validation, changing the design with CSS, or adding JavaScript functionality to enhance the user experience. This allows you to learn how to build on top of AI-generated work. Customizing Code: After getting some initial help from AI, try refactoring and customizing the code to fit your specific needs or style. This gives you practical experience with writing and debugging code. Combine Learning Resources:\nTutorials: Use tutorials (videos, blogs, or courses) to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you face difficulties, use AI tools to clarify concepts or assist with specific code snippets. Code Examples: Look at code examples from AI and then challenge yourself to replicate them from scratch. This forces you to learn the underlying concepts and not just rely on copy-paste solutions. Focus on Logic and Problem Solving:\nCoding is much more than just syntax. Focus on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. These concepts are universal, and even with AI, you’ll still need to know how to break down problems and create logical solutions. Use AI to brainstorm solutions or write out pseudocode, then translate that into your own code. How AI Can Help in Your Learning: Learning New Concepts: If you’re unsure about how something works in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, ask AI to explain it. AI can provide explanations, examples, and even mini tutorials. Code Snippets: When you’re writing CSS or JavaScript, AI can give you examples or snippets that can speed up your learning. But don’t just take them as is—tweak them and try to understand each part. Debugging: AI can help you debug code, but go through the process of understanding why an issue occurs. If AI points out an error, take the time to figure out why it happened and how to fix it yourself. Practical Steps for Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Start with HTML: Learn how to structure a web page using tags like , , , and . Understand how to work with links, images, forms, and tables.\nMove on to CSS: Learn how to style your web page using properties like color, font-family, padding, margin, and layout techniques (like Flexbox and Grid).\nMaster JavaScript: Once you’re comfortable with HTML and CSS, start learning JavaScript. Focus on variables, loops, conditionals, functions, objects, and arrays. Then progress to DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with APIs.\nBuild Projects: Apply your knowledge by building projects. Start with simple things like a personal portfolio, interactive forms, or a simple calculator. Then, gradually tackle more complex projects like todo apps, weather apps, or even a simple blog.\nFinal Thoughts: AI is an incredibly powerful tool to help you learn and code faster, but don’t let it replace the experience of manual coding. Use AI as a way to speed up your workflow, get unstuck, and explore new ideas, but keep your focus on learning the foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nIt’s awesome that you’re passionate about learning new things each day, and by combining both AI and manual coding, you’ll be able to accelerate your growth and become a more versatile developer.\n","wordCount":"980","inLanguage":"en","image":"//localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2024-12-06T08:13:00+06:00","dateModified":"2024-12-06T08:13:00+06:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sayfullah Sayeb"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"//localhost:1313/2024/12/why-manual-coding-is-still-important.html"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Sayfullah Sayeb","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"//localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=//localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Sayfullah Sayeb (Alt + H)">Sayfullah Sayeb</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=//localhost:1313/ title="Main Page"><span>Main Page</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/photography/ title=Photography><span>Photography</span></a></li><li><a href=//localhost:1313/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=//localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=//localhost:1313/posts/>Posts / index</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Manual Coding is Still Important</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-06 08:13:00.002 +0600 +06'>December 6, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sayfullah Sayeb</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#why-manual-coding-is-still-important>Why Manual Coding is Still Important:</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-balance-ai-and-manual-coding-in-your-learning>How to Balance AI and Manual Coding in Your Learning:</a></li><li><a href=#how-ai-can-help-in-your-learning>How AI Can Help in Your Learning:</a></li><li><a href=#practical-steps-for-learning-html-css-and-javascript>Practical Steps for Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</a></li><li><a href=#final-thoughts>Final Thoughts:</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>AI tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong>, and other code-generating AI systems can make coding much faster and more convenient, especially when you&rsquo;re trying to build projects or experiment with new concepts.
